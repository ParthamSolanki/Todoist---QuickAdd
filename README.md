# Why?
The todoist windows app felt really bulky since I just use it for its quick add functionality, that Ctrl+Space which open a window to quickly add task.

# How it works?
1. You store you todoist api key in a text file named "api_token.txt", you can use any name but you will have to change that in the script too. The todoist api key can be found in Todoist Settings > Integrations > Developer > Copy API token
2. Just download the script and keep it along with the api token file, if you want the script to run at startup, paste both these files in the startup folder.
3. Now uninstall todoist (if you have it) and when you press enter, it will open a window for adding text.
4. You will get popups for `#` and `@` which you can change from the script in line 32 and 33 as you need (just copy from you actual todoist account for consistency)
5. Beware that this script though fully functional can't replicate the todoist quick add windows completely.
